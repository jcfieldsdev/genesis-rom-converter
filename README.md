## Guide

Usage: `megarom input_file [output_file]`

If one argument given, shows ROM header information.

If two arguments given, converts bin to smd or smd to bin. Automatically detects format of input file.

## Acknowledgments

This is basically a rewrite of [GROM](https://www.zophar.net/utilities/segautil/grom.html) by [Bart Trzynadlowski](https://www.trzy.org/), with the following differences:

- Determines the format from the file contents instead of the file extension
- Requires the user to specify an output file
- Only works on one file at a time rather than accepting multiple inputs (use a shell `for` loop instead)

The last two make it work more consistently with other Unix utilities and more scriptable.
